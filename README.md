# RustPlug

Author: Mads Kjeldgaard

An example of using Rust to create a SuperCollider plugin. This plugin is silly and only uses Rust to change the gain of the samples but you can be creative with it however you want :)

It is set up to create a small rust libray which is then imported into the C++ side of the plugin. A bridge is automatically generated by the [cxx](https://cxx.rs/) and [corrosion-rs](https://corrosion-rs.github.io/corrosion/) for the CMake part of it. It is all downloaded automatically, including the SuperCollider source code needed, via the CPM package manager. 

To use this, simply clone this repo and replace the "RustPlug" name throughout the project with your own plugin name.

### Requirements

- CMake >= 3.15

### Building

Clone the project:

    git clone https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/rustplug
    cd rustplug
    mkdir build
    cd build

Then, use CMake to configure and build it:

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build . --config Release
    cmake --build . --config Release --target install

You may want to manually specify the install location in the first step to point it at your
SuperCollider extensions directory: add the option `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/extensions`.
